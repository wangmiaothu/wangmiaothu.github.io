#     We develop a simple model to interpret STM results on lightly doped Mott insulators, and find that the effective Mott gap measured by STM correspons to the one measured with other techniques when taking into account the poor electronic screeing.

#   image: Mott_phase_sep.jpg
#   description:
#     We discover of electronic order, pseudo gap phase separation and an impurity-band Mott transition in an iridate compound, cuprate-style. Along the way, we gained unique knowledge on how a Mott state collapses.

#   image: Pub_FP.png
#   description:
#     Both the density of states and the QPI dispersion of LiFeAs shows signatures of electron-boson coupling. Comparing these with fingerprints of different boson couplings to conclude that these signatures stem from AF spin fluctuations.
